=====

CloriSkip is a general STL-style Skip List.

Currently cloriSkip's most source code was copied from petegoodliffe's [skip_list](https://github.com/petegoodliffe/skip_list)--a delicate skip list implementation but, whose code is too old to maintain(and many thanks to petegoodliffe). Now cloriSkip has fixed some bug existing in petegoodliffe's version and use in other C++ projects, e.g. [cloriSearch](https://github.com/shpilu/cloriSearch).
