=====

CloriSkip is a general STL-style Skip List Container.

CloriSkip's most source code was copied from petegoodliffe's [skip_list](https://github.com/petegoodliffe/skip_list)(and many thanks to [petegoodliffe](https://github.com/petegoodliffe)) - a delicate skip list implementation but, whose code is too old to maintain. 

Now cloriSkip has fixed some bug existing in petegoodliffe's version and use in other C++ projects, e.g. [cloriSearch](https://github.com/shpilu/cloriSearch).
